<h1>Scope & Ethics</h1>
<p class="small">Professional boundaries, responsibilities, and operating standards.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This page exists to clearly define what 1440 Advisory Group does, what it does not do,
    and how authority, consent, and responsibility are governed. Clarity protects clients,
    families, partners, institutions, and outcomes.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Our role (defined)</h2>
<p>
  1440 Advisory Group provides clinically aligned advisory, coordination, and continuity
  services for individuals, families, and organizations navigating complex, high-risk
  transitions.
</p>
<p>
  We operate alongside licensed medical, psychiatric, and therapeutic providers—not in
  place of them. Our work focuses on structure, decision support, coordination,
  accountability, and continuity across transitions.
</p>

<h2>What we do not do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>provide medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic treatment</li>
  <li>diagnose conditions or prescribe medications</li>
  <li>replace licensed clinicians or facilities</li>
  <li>override clinical judgment</li>
  <li>operate without defined authority and consent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship to licensed care</h2>
<p>
  Licensed providers retain full clinical authority at all times. When clinical care is
  indicated, 1440 coordinates logistics, communication, and continuity while clinical
  decisions remain the responsibility of the licensed provider.
</p>

<h2>Authority, consent, and boundaries</h2>
<ul>
  <li>decision-making authority is defined in writing before engagement</li>
  <li>information sharing is consent-based and role-defined</li>
  <li>escalation and disengagement criteria are established in advance</li>
  <li>work does not proceed when authority or cooperation cannot be clarified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy and confidentiality</h2>
<p>
  1440 operates with HIPAA-aware workflows and alignment with applicable privacy standards,
  including 42 CFR Part 2 where relevant. Information is shared only with appropriate consent,
  on a minimum-necessary basis, and within legally permissible boundaries.
</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Professional conduct</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>clear scope boundaries</li>
    <li>respect for licensure and institutional roles</li>
    <li>disciplined communication standards</li>
    <li>avoidance of dependency creation or over-promising</li>
    <li>selective acceptance and right to disengage when required</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p class="small">
  This Scope & Ethics framework governs all 1440 Advisory Group engagements.
