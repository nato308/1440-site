<h1>Scope &amp; Ethics</h1>
<p class="small">Professional boundaries, responsibilities, and operating standards.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This page defines what 1440 Advisory Group does, what 1440 Advisory Group does not do, and how engagement is
    governed alongside licensed providers and institutions.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    Clarity protects clients, families, partners, and institutions. Ambiguity creates risk.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Our role</h2>
<p>
  1440 Advisory Group provides clinically aligned advisory, coordination, and continuity services for individuals,
  families, and organizations navigating complex, high-risk transitions related to substance use, behavioral-health
  instability, executive stress, and system breakdowns.
</p>
<p>
  1440 operates as a central coordinating and accountability authority, working alongside licensed professionals and
  institutions—not in place of them.
</p>

<h2>What this work is focused on</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Structure</li>
  <li>Decision support</li>
  <li>Coordination</li>
  <li>Accountability</li>
  <li>Continuity across transitions</li>
</ul>

<h2>What 1440 does not do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide medical care</li>
  <li>Provide psychiatric care</li>
  <li>Diagnose mental-health or substance-use disorders</li>
  <li>Provide psychotherapy or counseling</li>
  <li>Prescribe or manage medications</li>
  <li>Replace licensed clinicians or facilities</li>
  <li>Override clinical judgment</li>
  <li>Operate outside defined authority or consent agreements</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Relationship to licensed care</h2>
  <p>
    When clinical care is indicated, licensed providers retain full clinical authority. 1440 coordinates logistics,
    communication, and continuity within clearly defined scope.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clinical decisions remain the responsibility of the licensed provider.</li>
    <li>1440 does not interfere with treatment planning or clinical judgment.</li>
    <li>1440’s role is integration and governance, not treatment.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Withdrawal &amp; stabilization governance</h2>
<p>
  When withdrawal management or stabilization is required:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level-of-care determinations are made by licensed clinicians.</li>
  <li>All medical withdrawal management is delivered by licensed professionals.</li>
  <li>Home-based withdrawal is coordinated only when clinically appropriate and delivered under established protocols.</li>
  <li>1440 may coordinate providers, logistics, monitoring, and escalation—without providing medical treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">1440 does not improvise withdrawal management.</p>

<h2>Authority &amp; decision rights</h2>
<p>Before engagement, 1440 requires clear agreement regarding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who holds decision-making authority</li>
  <li>Cooperation thresholds and expectations</li>
  <li>How disagreements are resolved</li>
  <li>When escalation occurs</li>
  <li>When disengagement is required</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">
  If authority, consent, or cooperation cannot be clearly defined, 1440 will not proceed.
</p>

<h2>Family &amp; support-system ethics</h2>
<p>Family and support-system involvement is handled with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explicit consent</li>
  <li>Defined boundaries</li>
  <li>Clear communication rules</li>
  <li>Role clarity</li>
</ul>
<p>1440 does not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Share information without consent</li>
  <li>Triangulate communication</li>
  <li>Override client autonomy unless legally or ethically required</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">Family engagement is structured and governed, not informal.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Privacy, confidentiality &amp; consent</h2>
  <p>
    1440 operates with consent-based information sharing, minimum-necessary disclosure, and privacy-aware workflows.
    Where applicable, practices align with HIPAA-aware operations and 42 CFR Part 2 sensitivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information is shared only with appropriate consent, for coordination purposes, with clearly defined recipients,
    and within legally permissible boundaries.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Documentation &amp; communication standards</h2>
<p>1440 maintains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Written engagement agreements</li>
  <li>Defined communication protocols</li>
  <li>Documented escalation pathways</li>
  <li>Role clarity across involved parties</li>
</ul>
<p>We prioritize:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy over volume</li>
  <li>Clarity over speed</li>
  <li>Predictability over improvisation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selectivity and the right to decline or disengage</h2>
<p>1440 reserves the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decline situations that fall outside scope</li>
  <li>Disengage when cooperation breaks down</li>
  <li>Pause involvement if safety or ethical concerns arise</li>
  <li>Require additional licensed clinical involvement when risk escalates</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">Selectivity is an ethical obligation and a risk-management function.</p>

<h2>Professional conduct standards</h2>
<p>All 1440 work is governed by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrity in representation</li>
  <li>Respect for professional roles</li>
  <li>Avoidance of conflicts of interest</li>
  <li>Avoidance of dependency creation</li>
  <li>Avoidance of over-promising outcomes</li>
  <li>Calm, professional conduct under pressure</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">1440 does not guarantee outcomes. 1440 commits to process integrity and disciplined execution.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p class="small subtle" style="margin: 0;">
    Non-emergency disclaimer: 1440 Advisory Group does not provide emergency services. In cases of immediate danger
    or medical emergency, emergency services and licensed providers must be contacted immediately. 1440 may assist
    with coordination after appropriate emergency response has been initiated.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="small">
  Governing principle: Our responsibility is not to do everything. Our responsibility is to do the right things, in
  the right role, at the right time.
</p>
