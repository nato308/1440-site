<h1>Institutional Summary</h1>
<p class="small">
  Professional overview for hospitals, health systems, attorneys, and institutional partners.
</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    1440 Advisory Group provides clinically aligned advisory, coordination, and continuity services
    in high-risk, high-complexity situations where outcomes are vulnerable at transitions and handoffs.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Role clarity</h2>
<p>
  1440 operates as a coordinating and continuity authority alongside licensed medical, psychiatric,
  and therapeutic providers. Our role is intentionally scoped.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We do not provide medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic treatment.</li>
  <li>We do not diagnose, prescribe, or replace licensed clinicians.</li>
  <li>Licensed providers retain full clinical authority at all times.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What 1440 provides</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continuity across transitions between levels of care.</li>
  <li>Coordination among multiple providers and systems.</li>
  <li>Structured accountability outside clinical settings.</li>
  <li>Clarified authority, communication pathways, and escalation logic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common institutional use cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Elevated discharge or transition risk.</li>
  <li>Fragmentation across providers or care settings.</li>
  <li>Family dynamics that materially affect outcomes.</li>
  <li>High-discretion or executive circumstances requiring added structure.</li>
  <li>Situations where accountability outside clinical care reduces risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When 1440 is not appropriate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Required licensed clinical care is not in place.</li>
  <li>Authority, consent, or cooperation cannot be clearly defined.</li>
  <li>Expectations involve diagnosis, therapy, prescribing, or medical treatment.</li>
  <li>Collaboration with licensed providers is not possible.</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Engagement approach</h2>
  <p>
    Engagement is referral-based and exploratory. Initial conversations focus on fit, scope alignment,
    authority clarity, and risk assessment before any engagement is considered.
