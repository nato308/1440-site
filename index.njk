<h1>1440 Advisory Group</h1>
<p class="small">Clinically aligned advisory, coordination, and continuity services.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
  1440 provides continuity and coordination in high-risk, high-complexity situations where outcomes are vulnerable
  at transitions and handoffs.
</p>

</div>

<h2>What we do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide structure, accountability, and continuity across transitions.</li>
  <li>Coordinate alongside licensed medical, psychiatric, and therapeutic providers.</li>
  <li>Clarify authority, roles, communication pathways, and escalation logic.</li>
  <li>Reduce fragmentation when multiple systems and stakeholders are involved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When 1440 is appropriate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continuity between levels of care is critical.</li>
  <li>Multiple providers require alignment.</li>
  <li>Family dynamics materially affect outcomes.</li>
  <li>Transitions (discharge, return home, travel, work) carry elevated risk.</li>
  <li>Accountability outside clinical settings materially reduces risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When 1440 is not appropriate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Required licensed clinical care is not in place.</li>
  <li>Authority and consent cannot be clearly defined.</li>
  <li>Expectations involve diagnosis, therapy, prescribing, or medical treatment.</li>
  <li>Collaboration and accountability are not possible.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Initial contact</h2>
  <p>
    Initial contact is referral-based and exploratory. We prioritize clarity, fit, and scope alignment before any
    engagement is considered.
