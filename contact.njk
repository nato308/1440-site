<h1>Contact</h1>
<p class="small">Referral-based, exploratory introduction.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>How contact works</h2>
  <p>
    Initial contact is referral-based and exploratory. We prioritize clarity, fit, and scope alignment
    before any engagement is considered.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Message guidance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Briefly describe the situation and why continuity or coordination risk is elevated.</li>
  <li>Confirm whether licensed medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic care is currently in place (if applicable).</li>
  <li>Clarify who holds decision authority and whether consent can be established.</li>
  <li>Indicate the desired outcome of an initial alignment conversation (e.g., assess fit, define roles, determine next steps).</li>
</ul>

<h2>When not to contact 1440</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Urgent or emergency situations (see disclaimer below).</li>
  <li>Requests for diagnosis, therapy, prescribing, or medical treatment.</li>
  <li>Situations where authority and consent cannot be clearly defined.</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel">
  <h2>Response expectations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Responses are exploratory and scope-focused.</li>
    <li>If fit is unclear, we may decline or recommend appropriate licensed resources.</li>
    <li>If there is potential fit, we will outline a simple next-step process for role clarity and consent.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
