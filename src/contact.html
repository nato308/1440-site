      <h2>How contact works</h2>
      <p>
        Initial contact is referral-based and exploratory. We prioritize clarity, fit, and scope alignment
        before any engagement is considered.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Message guidance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Briefly describe the situation and why continuity or coordination risk is elevated.</li>
      <li>Confirm whether licensed medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic care is currently in place (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Clarify who holds decision authority and whether consent can be established.</li>
      <li>Indicate the desired outcome of an initial alignment conversation (e.g., assess fit, define roles, determine next steps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What not to send</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>clinical records unless requested and appropriate consent is established</li>
      <li>urgent or emergency messages (see disclaimer below)</li>
      <li>requests for diagnosis, therapy, prescribing, or medical treatment</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Response expectations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Responses are exploratory and scope-focused.</li>
        <li>If fit is unclear, we may decline or recommend appropriate licensed resources.</li>
        <li>If there is potential fit, we will outline a simple next-step process for role clarity and consent.</li>
      </ul>
