      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>
        1440 Advisory Group provides clinically aligned advisory, coordination, and continuity services
        designed to operate alongside licensed medical, psychiatric, and therapeutic providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our role is intentionally scoped. We do not replace licensed providers. We provide structure,
        accountability, coordination, and continuity where outcomes most often fail—at transitions,
        handoffs, and points of fragmentation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The problem we address</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>transitions between levels of care</li>
      <li>fragmented or conflicting recommendations</li>
      <li>unmanaged family-system dynamics</li>
      <li>lack of continuity after discharge or stabilization</li>
      <li>unclear authority and responsibility</li>
      <li>privacy and consent breakdowns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When 1440 is appropriate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>complexity exceeds what any single provider or institution can manage alone</li>
      <li>continuity between inpatient, outpatient, and home settings is critical</li>
      <li>multiple providers require alignment</li>
      <li>family dynamics materially affect outcomes</li>
      <li>executive or high-discretion circumstances require added structure</li>
      <li>transitions carry elevated risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When 1440 is not appropriate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>licensed clinical care is required and not in place</li>
      <li>authority and consent cannot be clearly defined</li>
      <li>expectations involve diagnosis, therapy, or medical treatment</li>
      <li>collaboration and accountability are not possible</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="panel">
      <h2>Service architecture</h2>
      <p class="small">High-level view. Phases are scoped, documented, and time-bounded.</p>
